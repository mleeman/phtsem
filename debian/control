Description: pth replacement with semaphore support - development files
 This package provides GNU Portable Threads enhanced with semaphore
 support.
 .
 Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
 which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
 threads of execution (aka ``multithreading'') inside event-driven
 applications. All threads run in the same address space of the server
 application, but each thread has it's own individual program-counter,
 run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
 This package provides the development files of GPU pth enhanced with
 semaphore support.
